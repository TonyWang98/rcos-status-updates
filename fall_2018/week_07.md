## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I make a very cool Vue component for querying. I am trying to connect the new component with the existed filter, but I can solve this problem very soon. 


## This Week's Plan

> I will connect my table with the database from scheduling group.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am estimating the amount of statics from the database and my algorithm's order notation. I will try to improve the logic of filter as fast as possible.
