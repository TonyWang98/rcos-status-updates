## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I am considering to change some algorithm and data structure of the table. Therefore, I can implement filter and buttons more efficiently.
However, since I had Programming Languages examination and Game Development presentation, I didn't do much work.   


## This Week's Plan

> I will change the new version of data structure and implement filter.

## Anything Blocking?

> The new data structure may create new conflicts. Therefore, our group need to communicate with scheduling group frequently.

## Notes
