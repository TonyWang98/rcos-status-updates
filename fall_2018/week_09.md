## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I successfully move the data from Javascript to a JSON file and link the JSON file and the Javascript together. I am prepared to replace JSON from schedule group to the demo JSON.

## This Week's Plan

> I will link the JSON file from schedule group and try to send a pull request.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have four projects due in the next weeks. I need to distribute my time carefully.
