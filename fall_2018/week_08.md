## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I almost finish the all the coding part (the algorithm of showing table and the filter). I improved my algorithm many times.

## This Week's Plan

> I will connect my table to the schedule database group. Although there must be some conflicts between our coding, it's my duty to solve the conflict.

## Anything Blocking?

> I hope that there are fewer conflicts. I think the database group needs to change their database a little so that I hope they have enough time to deal with.
